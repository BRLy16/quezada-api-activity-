3. ## Best Practices Implementation
4. **1. Environment Variables:**
5. - Why did we put `BASE_URI` in `.env` instead of hardcoding it?
6. - Answer: We placed `BASE_URI` in the `.env` file to keep configuration values separate from the source code. This improves security, makes the application easier to maintain, and allows us to change the base URL depending on the environment (development, testing, or production) without modifying the actual code.

7. **2. Resource Modeling:**
8. - Why did we use plural nouns (e.g., `/dishes`) for our routes?
9. - Answer: Plural nouns are used because RESTful APIs represent collections of resources. Using plural naming conventions makes the API more consistent, readable, and aligned with REST standards, especially when performing CRUD operations on multiple items.
10. **3. Status Codes:**
11. - When do we use `201 Created` vs `200 OK`?
    - Answer: `201 Created` is used when a new resource is successfully created, such as after a POST request. `200 OK` is used when a request is successful but does not create a new resource, like fetching or updating data.  
12. - Why is it important to return `404` instead of just an empty array or a generic error?
13. - Answer: Returning a `404 Not Found` status code is important because it clearly informs the client that the requested resource does not exist. This improves error handling, debugging, and ensures proper communication between the server and the client.
